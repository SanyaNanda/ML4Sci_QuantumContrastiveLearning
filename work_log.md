COMMUNITY BONDING

WEEK 1
- Attended GSoC Contributors Summit on 7th May, 2024
- Participated in first weekly QMLHEP sync up on 8th May, 2024. Some key-takeaways from sync up 1:
	- Meet and Greet
	- FAQs and more about the timeline and expectation
	- Communication Channel setup on Mattermost
	- Mid-Term Evaluation Expectation: Code and Blog
	- Prepare a presentation on the project idea and your approach
	- Try out cutting edge technology relating to your problem
- Researched particle physics, contrastive learning and end-to-end ML project structure 
- Connected with mentors for introduction and general questions

WEEK 2
- Further research on Contrastive Learning
- Explored more on Quantum Machine Learning

WEEK 3
- Attended GSoC FAQ session on 23 May, 2024
- Presented the plan and approach for the summer in weekly sync up and got feedback on the way forward ([slide](https://github.com/SanyaNanda/ML4Sci_QuantumContrastiveLearning/blob/main/slides/ML4Sci-QuantumContrastiveLearning.pdf))

CODING

WEEK 1: 27 May - 3 June
- Repository set up
- Data loading and visualization of electron-photon dataset
- Experiment 1: Classical Base Model using CNN layers along with contrastive pair loss on MNIST dataset
- Exploring different ways to integrate quantum layer in the base model to make it hybrid
- Sync up: actively listened to other contributor's presentation to get a better understanding of their projects


WEEK 2: 3 June - 10 June

- Working on Experiment 2: Hybrid Base Model using CNN layers along with contrastive pair loss on MNIST dataset
- Hybrid model uses a qunatum cicruit as keras quantum layer in the base cnn model
- Both classical an dhybrid base model perform well on mnist dataset

WEEK 3: 10 June - 17 June
- Ran both the classical and hybrid model on electron photon data
- The models didn't perform well on validation dataset, with validation loss not coming below 0.5 which means the model guess on new data
- Reviewed more research papers on a new angle and documented the learnings

WEEK 4: 17 June - 24 June
